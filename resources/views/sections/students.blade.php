                    The best thing about studying adult nursing is you get to nurse a good 
                    range of patients, ranging from 18 to 100 years old, which is such a 
                    privilege. I have this innate desire to make a positive difference to people.
                    The clinical practice team are very knowledgeable and they know exactly 
                    what they want from us;

                    I chose children’s nursing so that I could work with the families as well as the 
                    child. A lot of children are too young to have their own voice so through nursing,
                    you can hopefully give them that voice. The family wants to know everything about 
                    their child; they can be challenging because as a student, you don’t always have 
                    the answers.

                I chose this field because I want to help some of the most vulnerable people in society, 
                especially in the learning disability population, as they face many challenges in their life. 
                I worked as a healthcare assistant in a learning disability respite before commencing on the course.

                I chose the course at Anglia Ruskin as it was voted one of the most successful places to study this course.
                The course allows you to experience both the Cardiac & Vascular and Respiratory & Sleep disciplines in 
                year 1, so that you can choose which area to specialise in during years 2 and 3.

                As part of my continuing professional development and acute care degree I have undertaken modules in 
                mentorship, cardiac arrhythmias, cardiac rehab and the care of the acutely ill patient. At the time, 
                I was working on a cardiac ward so the modules benefitted my knowledge for the ward and allowed me to 
                disseminate the knowledge I had learnt to my patients, as well as staff
